                            and downs in the commercial website industry. Scandia was founded when the Umbraco CMS
                            was in its infancy, and Nik was one of the first adopters of the software in the USA. He
                            is the author of the only published book on Umbraco and continues to be an authority on

                            holds a B.A degree in computer science from Johnson & Wales University. At Scandia, Nik
                            handles our business administration and guides the team by providing guidelines and

                                    Scandia was founded in 2005 by Nik
                                    Wahlberg, an architect and veteran of the IT consulting field. His original
                                    vision - to leverage the Web to provide value-added software solutions for
                                    clients - still holds true today. Our national and global clients span the
                                    healthcare, biotech, financial and manufacturing sectors.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Scandia is on track
                                    with the rapid pace of technology trends and we regularly incorporate these
                                    innovations in our solutions. Our clients stay ahead of the curve in UX, visual
                                    design and the most modern codebases available. Our native language here is
                                    Umbraco,
                                    and we also speak AngularJs, HTML5, iOS and .Net, just to name a few.
